If you got Tor as a static binary with OpenSSL included, then you should know:
 "This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
 for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)"
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
"This program uses the IP-to-Country Database provided by
WebHosting.Info (http://www.webhosting.info), available from
http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info."
See the src/config/geoip file in particular.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
Orbot also uses iptables from the Netfilter.org project

netfilter/iptables is - like all of the Linux Kernel - Free Software (sometimes
referred to as Open Source Software), distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2
only. Please, note that some source code files might differ, and in that case it
is explicitely stated in the header of every file.

The GPL also contains some obligations. If you distribute netfilter/iptables code
in binary form, you have to offer the source code, too.
